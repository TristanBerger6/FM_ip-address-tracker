Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

### Built with

This project was built using React / SASS along with CSS custom properties. It uses Ip Geolocation API by IPify, and LeafletJS to generate the map.
